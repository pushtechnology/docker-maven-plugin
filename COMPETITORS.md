Why should you use this one in preference to other plugins?

* Avoids XML configuration, uses YAML similar to Fig (aka Docker Compose) so should be easier to learn.
* Uses docker-java under the hood, so is up to date with latest Docker APIs.
* Will support Gradle and Ant builds.
* Focused on building and testing containers.
* Automatically sets up Boot2Docker port forwarding.
