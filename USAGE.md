* `copy` - copy resources from a Docker container
* `save` - save images to file, optionally deploy to Maven repository
* `log` - save logs.

Pre-requisites
---
Docker installed and Docker daemon running, see the docker [getting started guide](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/) for e.g. on a mac follow these [instructions](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/mac/).

Usage
---
The best example to look at is the [one from the tests](src/it/build-test-it) which creates a [Drop-Wizard](https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/) app and builds three containers: __app__ (the dropwizard application) __data__ and __mysql__, and then runs an integration test against the deployed app. Et voila a packaged image!

Typically, you build your app, run your standard unit tests and package it as usual. Then, you build a container with your app deployed onto it, and run integration tests against it. If they pass, deploy your jar into the Maven repository, and optionally, your image into a Docker repository.

To use the plugin, you need to define a `docker/` directory in `${basedir}/src/main` which will include a subdirectory for each container that you wish to deploy.

- `src/main/docker/` contains one folder per container for e.g. the mysql container would have a folder structure as follows:
    - mysql
        - `Dockerfile` a standard Docker file.
        - `conf.yml` configuration:
    - ...
        - `Dockerfile` a standard Docker file.
        - `conf.yml` configuration:

```yml
# additional data require to create the Docker image
packaging:
  # files to add to the build, usually used with ADD in the Dockerfile
  add:
    - target/example-${project.version}.jar
    # you can also disable filtering
    - path: hello-world.yml
      filter: false
# optional list of port to expose on the host
ports:
  - 8080
  # If you want a different host port used, where the former is the exposed port and the latter the container port.
  - 8001 1802
# containers that this should be linked to, started before this one and stopped afterwards, optional alias after colon
links:
  - mysql:db
healthChecks:
  pings:
     # check this URL for 200 OK
     - https://localhost:8446/info
     # check another URL with non-default time out, with a pattern, and non checking SSL certificates
     - url: https://localhost:8446/info
       timeout: 60000
       pattern: pattern that must be in the body of the return value
       sslVerify: false
  logPatterns:
     - pattern that must be in log file
     - pattern: another pattern with non-default timeout
       timeout: 30000
# how long in milliseconds to sleep after start-up (default 0), note health checks are usually faster and more reliable
sleep: 1000
# log failures (default true, 10)
logOnFailure: true
maxLogLines: 10
# volumes to mount from other containers
volumesFrom: busybox
# volume to map
volumes:
# dir in image to host dir
  /mnt/target: target/docker
# if this should be enabled (default true)
enabled: true
# expose the container's IP (see below)
exposeContainerIp: true
# tag to use for images
tag: alex.e.c-app:${project.artifactId}-${project.version}
# or multiple tags
tags:
    - alex.e.c-app:${project.artifactId}-${project.version}
# Run the container in privileged mode (default false)
privileged: false
container:
    # a name for the container (if omitted, we will create an artifical one)
    name: theName
 ```

If you only want to use another image as a build dependency, you can provide a simple `Dockerfile` with just the image, e.g.

```
FROM mysql
```

Add the following to the `pom.xml` plugins section.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.alexecollins.docker</groupId>
    <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <!-- out of the box, you shoud not need to have these, as they'll use sensible defaults -->
        <!-- (optional) your installed version -->
        <version>1.13</version>
        <!-- (optional) if you want to push to a private repo, all of these are required if using artifactory -->
        <username>alexec</username>
        <password>password</password>
        <email>alex.e.c@gmail.com</email>
        <serverAddress>https://index.docker.io/v1/</serverAddress>
        <!-- (optional) change here if you are using another port/host, e.g. 4243 -->
        <host>http://localhost:2375</host>
        <!-- (optional) if you need to run with configured SSL certificates -->
        <dockerCertPath>${user.home}/.docker</dockerCertPath>
        <!-- (optional) remove images created by Dockerfile (default false) -->
        <removeIntermediateImages>false</removeIntermediateImages>
        <!-- (optional) do/do not cache images (default true), disable to get the freshest images -->
        <cache>true</cache>
        <!-- (optional) exclude certain images -->
        <exclude>app,other</exclude>
        <!-- (optional) ignore problems with permission errors (e.g. if running on CircleCI -->
        <permissionErrorTolerant>true</permissionErrorTolerant>
        <!-- (optional) only remove containers on clean, do not remove images -->
        <cleanContainerOnly>false</cleanContainerOnly>
        <!-- (optional) where to same images -->
        <saveDir>target/docker</saveDir>
        <!-- (optional) save files to reduce disk space usage -->
        <gzipSave>false</gzipSave>
        <!-- (optional) attached saved files for deployment to local repo or Maven repo -->
        <attach>false</attach>
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <!-- set-up port forwarding if you're using boot2docker -->
            <groupId>com.alexecollins.docker</groupId>
            <artifactId>docker-java-orchestration-plugin-boot2docker</artifactId>
            <version>???</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
 ```

Note: we default to HTTPS. However, on Linux the default is un-secured HTTP. Try `<host>http://localhost:2375</host>`.

There are other [configuration options](https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java#configuration), including via system environment here, which might be preferable if you have a number of builds using the plugin.

Create your `${basedir}/src/main/docker` directory and create a subfolder for your application container

     mkdir -p src/main/docker/app
 
Define your Dockerfile and conf.yml and place in ${basedir}/src/main/docker/app

 ```tree
    src/main/docker/app
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── conf.yml
 ```

You can now invoke functionality from the plugin, information on the plugin can be found by running the following command

     mvn docker:help

For e.g. to build containers from their `Dockerfile` and `conf.yml` files, run the following command

     mvn docker:package

Expose container IP as maven properties
---

By default, the container ip will be exposed as maven properties. This would be helpful for integration test as it doesn't require bind the exposed port of container to a well know port of the host.

The property name is `docker.` + directory name of each Dockerfile + `.ipAddress`. For example, by configuring `maven-failsafe-plugin` in the following way:

```
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.14.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <systemPropertyVariables>
                        <example.app.ip>${docker.app.ipAddress}</example.app.ip>
                    </systemPropertyVariables>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>integration-test</goal>
                            <goal>verify</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

In the test, the ip address can be obtained by:


```
         String host = System.getProperty("example.app.ip");
```

We can also use the container ip address for health check.  This can be done by using `__CONTAINER.IP__` as a placeholder in the pings url. For example: 


```yml
healthChecks:
  pings:
    - url: http://__CONTAINER.IP__:8080/hello-world
      timeout: 60000

```

This can be turned off by set `exposeContainerIp` to `false` in `conf.yml`

Copy resources from a docker container
---

The copy command allows you to extract resources from your docker container, allowing you to use docker as a build engine from within maven.
The resources to copy are specified by `source` and the location to copy to by `dest`. If `source` is a directory then the directory
contents will be copied. `dest` can be a file or directory, if a directory then the resource names will be preserved.
